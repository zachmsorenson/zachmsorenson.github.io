            Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in source code and making it easier for multiple people to collaborate on a shared project. Github is a web-service for hosting project repositories using Git. This tutorial will take you through the basics of using Git and Github to create and manage your projects, and hosting a basic webpage through Github Pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <span class="italics">repository</span> functions as the root directory that a project is located. Alongside all the source code or data you may need, the repository also holds some <span class="italics">metadata</span>. This is information necessary for the version control system - things like directory structure, project history, and the address of the repository. Git store this metadata in a folder called .git (the leading . indicates this is a hidden folder) and takes care of most of this on its own.
          </p>
          <p>
            GitHub stores this repository online. It can then be downloaded (<span class="italics">cloned</span>) to a local machine where you can work on it. All changes (adding/removing files and editing existing files) are made to the local copy of the project. The user must then explicitly <span class="italics">push</span> their changes to the online repository in order to update it. This allows multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously. When users push their updates, Git the version control system attempts to <span class="italics">merge</span> differences automatically - if conflicts occur, the updating user is required to resolve them.

        <h2>1) Sign-Up for Github</h2>
        <p>
          GitHub is free to use - sign-up can be found <a href="https://github.com/join?source=header-home">here</a>. I would recommend using your student email for extra goodies that we get. The GitHub Student Developer Pack can be found <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">here</a> once you create your account.

        <h2>3) Generate an SSH Key for Your Device</h2>
        <h2>4) Getting Started on Github Pages</h2>
        <p>
          GitHub Pages allows you to host a static website for your account under the domain &lt;USERNAME&gt;.github.io. This is a great way to learn some basics of web development! It's a very simple way to put up some HTML and play around. In fact, the webpage you are reading right now is hosted through GitHub Pages!
