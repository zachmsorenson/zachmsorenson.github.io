          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <div class="col-sm-12">
            <p>
              Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in source code and making it easier for multiple people to collaborate on a shared project. Github is a web-service for hosting project repositories using Git. This tutorial will take you through the basics of using Git and Github to create and manage your projects, and hosting a basic webpage through Github Pages.
            </p>
            <p>
              A <span class="italics">repository</span> functions as the root directory that a project is located. Alongside all the source code or data you may need, the repository also holds some <span class="italics">metadata</span>. This is information necessary for the version control system - things like directory structure, project history, and the address of the repository. Git store this metadata in a folder called .git (the leading . indicates this is a hidden folder) and takes care of most of this on its own.
            </p>
            <p>
              GitHub stores this repository online. It can then be downloaded (<span class="italics">cloned</span>) to a local machine where you can work on it. All changes (adding/removing files and editing existing files) are made to the local copy of the project. The user must then explicitly <span class="italics">push</span> their changes to the online repository in order to update it. This allows multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously. When users push their updates, Git the version control system attempts to <span class="italics">merge</span> differences automatically - if conflicts occur, the updating user is required to resolve them.

                GitHub is free to use - sign-up can be found <a href="https://github.com/join?source=header-home" target="_blank">here</a>. I would recommend using your student email for extra goodies that we get, namely the ability to create private repositories. The GitHub Student Developer Pack can be found <a href="https://education.github.com/pack" target="_blank">here</a> once you create your account.

              <p>
                You must download Git to be able to clone repos from GitHub and use all the nice Git commands used for version control. Git can be downloaded <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">here</a>. You'll want to pick and choose the right version for your OS. Linux (and I believe Mac as well) and install and use Git straight in the terminal, while the Windows version installs a program called "Git Bash" - this is effectively just a Bash terminal you can use within Windows that gives you the exact same functionality. If you aren't use to using a command-line terminal yet (or just prefer a GUI) you can find a list of Git GUI clients on their site <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis" target="_blank">here</a> - GitHub Desktop is probably the most common one of these.

            <div class="col-sm-12">
              <p>
                Note about using Git Bash for Windows: Git Bash uses Vim as its default text editor, which is notorious for being very unintuitive and hard-to-learn if you are new to using the command-line. During installation, you will be asked if you would like to change this - if you are new to using a command-line interface, I would recommend using a different editor. Nano is one of the more user-friendly terminal-based text editors, otherwise feel free to use something with a GUI (Notepad++, Sublime, VS Code, etc).
              </p>
              <p>
                You can change Git's default text editor using the command <code>git config --global core.editor &quot;&lt;TEXT_EDITOR&gt;&quot;</code>

          <!-- CHAPTER 3 -->
          <h2>3) Generate an SSH Key for Your Device</h2>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-12">
              <p>
                Normally, every time you attempt to push changes to a repository, you will be prompted to type your GitHub credentials to verify your identity. Instead of this, you can create an SSH key on the device you're working on and register that device with GitHub using its key. This will automatically authorize you when pushing changes from the registered device.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first step of this process is generating your SSH key. GitHub's own instructions can be found <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/">here</a> - they do a better job than I would of explaining the process. This process requires use of the Terminal (Linux/Mac) or the use of Git Bash (Windows). 
              </p>
              <p>
                Once you have generated your key, you will have to add it to GitHub. If you followed the above help page, the default location for your key is in <code>&lt;YOUR_USER_DIRECTORY&gt;/.ssh/id_rsa</code>. Note that the .ssh directory is a <span class="italics">hidden</span> directory. Once you have the id_rsa file, you can open it with a text editor to copy the key. The following instructions lay out adding the key to GitHub:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Click on the account icon in the upper-right</li>
                <li>Click on 'Settings'</li>
                <li>Click 'SSH and GPG keys' on the left-hand menu</li>
                <li>Click 'New SSH key'
                  <ul>
                    <li>Enter a unique name&nbsp;into the 'Title' field (e.g. "My Laptop" or "UST OSS 428")</li>
                    <li>Copy and paste your public SSH key (for your specific computer) into the 'Key' field</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Click 'Add SSH key'</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- CHAPTER 4 -->
          <h2>4) Creating Your Account Website on Github Pages</h2>
          <p>
            GitHub Pages allows you to host a static website for your account under the domain &lt;USERNAME&gt;.github.io. This is a great way to learn some basics of web development! It's a very simple way to put up some HTML and play around. In fact, the webpage you are reading right now is hosted through GitHub Pages!
          </p>
          <p>
            To create your account website, you have to make a repository called &lt;USERNAME&gt;.github.io, where &lt;USERNAME&gt; is your GitHub account name. GitHub SHOULD then automatically serve any .html files you specify within that repository - for instance, this tutorial is the file ~/tutorials/github.html in my account page repository. Also note that if you don't specify a file (i.e. browse to <span class="italics">username</span>.github.io/) the web server will try to serve index.html. This is standard on the web.
          </p>



		<!-- CHAPTER  -->
		<h2>) Resolving a Merge Conflict. </h2>
		Often times when working with multiple people on the same project, you will get the situation where two people will make two different changes to the same section of code. When this happens a merge conflict is creted. 
		You will most likely see something like <pre> CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in &lt;FILE&gt; </pre> where file is the file containing the merge conflict. The issue here is that there were two changes to be made to the same bit of code, so git doesn't know which change should be made, and is now asking your to choose which change should be made. 
		Once you open a file, a merge confict will likely look something like this (Unless your IDE does something special) 
&nbsp; 
	<pre> 	
		&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
		this is one version of the code
		=======
		this is another verison of the code.
		&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; different_branch 
		rest of your code. </pre> 

	To resolve this you will need to decide which version of that code snippet you want to keep. You have to be careful that you don't break any other additional features that are dependent on this snippet of code. 


          <h2>5) Submitting code with pull requests. </h2>
              <p>
			  When you are all finished writting your code, the typical method for submiting your code (especially for open source projects) is through submitting a pull request to the person that is maintaining the repostiory where the project you are working on is stored. Here is the methodology to do so.
			  <ol>
				  	<li> Create a fork of the repostiory that you want to work on. You can do this by hitting the "Fork" button in the upper right hand of the page of the repository that you want to do work on. This is basically just cloning your own copy of the repository, and then putting that into a new repositry that you own. 
					<li> From there you will get your own version of that repo that is now under your github name. Clone the version under your name onto your machine. 
					<li> Use git add, git commit, and git push to make chages to your forked repository. 
					<li> Sidenote: If you need to pull down upstream changes from the original repository, then you might have to add the original repository as a remote to your project. To do this do the following.  
						<ol>
							<li> Navigate into your repository on your machine. 
							<li> Commit all your changes. 
							<li>  <span style="display: inline;"> run the command: <pre>git remote add &lt;name&gt; &lt;url&gt; </pre> with the name you want to use to refer to the repo, and the url of the original repository that you want to pull down changes from. 
									<li> <span style="display: inline;"> pull down the changes: <pre> git pull origin &lt;name&gt; </pre> where name is the name of the remote repository that you want to pull changes from. You can use <pre> git remote -v </pre> to view all of the remote repositories that you have added to your project. 
							<li> If the upstream repo made changes to the same bit of code that you have, you might have to solve for a merge conflict. You can find information on resolving merge conflicts in section #####.
						</ol>
					<li> Once you have made all your changes and you are ready to submit your code, you will go to the github page of the original repository. 
					<li> Click on the "New Pull Request" button that is next to the button where you select the branch you are viewing.
					<li> Click on "Compare accross forks" 
					<li> You will want to merge your forked repository into this repository, so make sure the base is the branch you want to merge into, and the compare is your fork, and compare is the branch you want to merge into the base branch. 
					<li> From there you will hit "Create pull request", then the maintainers of the repository will review your code, and if it is good enough they will accept your merge request and add your code into their repository. However, often times the maintainer may ask you to change something, or fix a bug before he/she pulls your code into their codebase, so make sure your code is well tested, and looks good! 
			  </ol>
